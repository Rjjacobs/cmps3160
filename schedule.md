## Important Resources for the Semester

* [Link to the Git Repo for the Course!](https://github.com/nmattei/cmps3160)
* While we make every effort to keep these tables up to date, if there is ever a conflict on due date, the assignment due date in [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) supersedes anything posted here.**
* All Demo Notebooks can be [found here on Github](https://github.com/nmattei/cmps3160/tree/master/_demos).
* All slides including the pre-class announcements can be found [(here on Google Drive!)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bVg_0m4Za_S2qWGja_KpLNdiiQZkSoOm?usp=sharing)
* Important to all coding in this class is becoming a better coder! One handy resource for this is [Arie's Coding Guide](https://nmattei.github.io/cmps3140/codingguide). Note that this was written for Intro. to AI CMPS 3140 but many of the same issues apply to this course
