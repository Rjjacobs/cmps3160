    "## Project Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are considering working with is [The Global Gender Gap Index](https://data.world/hdx/29f2f52f-a9c2-4ff9-a99e-42b894dc18e9). This data is collected from [The Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-gender-gap-index-world-economic-forum). The Global Gender Gap Index measures the relative gaps between women and men over a large set of countries across four key areas: health, education, economics and politics. In this dataset, the gender gap index score is on a 0-1 scale with 0 being complete inequality and 1 being complete equality. We are interested in this dataset because it describes an important aspect of gender equality, especially between different countries. We would like to examine gender inequality in terms of different countries and how inequality has changed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining each country we can also see how the four key areas - health, education, economics, and politics, influence the gender gap index. The ranks and scores of each of these areas are organized in the table-3b-detailed-rankings-2013-csv-2.csv by country. Because this data provides a score for each country individually every year, we can use this data to compare the trends from different countries and dive deeper into how these gender gap indexes are derived. We can also answer questions such as, what issues are most prevalent in the world? Furthermore, we can examine the data alongside other country-wide factor datasets such as datasets on each country’s predominant religion, government type, legislation, and social norms. Through this examination, we can answer questions such as what characteristics might contribute to each country’s gender gap score and how it has changed over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While this dataset only supplies data from 2006-2013, we plan to scrape data for the years 2014-2021 from the annual Gender Gap Index Reports found at the [World Economic Forum’s website](https://www.weforum.org/reports/ab6795a1-960c-42b2-b3d5-587eccda6023). Doing so will enable us to make more accurate judgements about current gender equality measures and predict the direction it is going in the future. \n"
